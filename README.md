# Movie Recommender System

This is a repository for IN4331: Web Data Management (Q4 2017/2018) course project in the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/).

In this project we process the [MovieLens 20M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) to gain insight and generate movie recommendation list by doing an experiment with various systems.

The experiment setup includes combination of using Apache Spark, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and GraphX. We first did an experiment on comparing how well the setup deals with complex queries that is related to recommendation system. Then, we focus on how we use these systems to compute the recommendation - using a matrix factorization approach.
